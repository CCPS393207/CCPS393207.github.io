    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Personally and professionally, I'm looking forward to being successful in whatever career I do. I will be working towards this goal by working hard and diligently on tasks I have to do. Values I think that are needed for my goal are respect responsible and hardworking. Short-term goals I wish to accomplish in the near future include Dual Enrollment, finishing all my core classes early, and maybe graduating early. Some character traits I want to be most known for are being respectful and hardworking. I work very well by myself, or with other people and I can finish projects and assignments before it's due.</p>
